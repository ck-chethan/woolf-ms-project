# E-Commerce Microservices Backend Project

## 📘 Overview

This project is a modular **E-commerce Backend System** built using **Spring Boot Microservices** architecture. It is designed for scalability, security, and real-time performance, and simulates real-world backend services for an online shopping platform.

Each core functionality—**product management**, **user authentication**, **payment processing**, and **email notifications**—is developed as an independent microservice with asynchronous communication using Kafka and secure APIs using OAuth2 & JWT.

This work is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the **Master of Science in Computer Science** at **Scaler Neovarsity - Woolf**.
